# STM32F10x Standard Peripherals Library
## Version 3.6.0 20-September-2021

I can't find the official firmware library of STM32F103 in ST official. Coincidentally, I downloaded the firmware library of 3.6.0 before, so I uploaded it to Github for sharing and downloading.
ST officials have the final interpretation right.

This bro gave me the inspiration to upload this document

Thank you.
